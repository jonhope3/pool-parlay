        <p>Welcome to Pool Parlay!</p>
        <section class="how-it-works">
            <p>Pool Parlay is a fun way to make wagers with friends. In sports betting, a parlay bet is when you
                make more than one bet and combine them into one wager. At Pool Parlay, we're a social group. We like to
                talk about what we think might happen, and we like to talk about what might not happen, but we all enjoy
                it most
                when we agree... and when we're all right!
            </p>
            <p>
                What you'll do is decide amongst your friends, through anonymous polls, what is going to happen.
                Once you all agree on what will or will not happen, you place a wager! The goal is to <strong>place
                a wager together</strong> with the
                benefit of everyone's agreement that <i>these things are going to happen</i>. Your group will
                place a wager consisting of
                everyone's buy-ins, and watch how your predictions turn out. Afterward, we'll show you your group's wager, and
                the outcome!
            </p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy your Pool Parlay... dive right in!</p>

            <h4>Step 1. <strong>Discuss and Decide</strong></h4>
            <p>Gather with your friends and use anonymous polls to agree on predictions about sports or other events.</p>

            <h4>Step 2. <strong>Place a Collective Bet</strong></h4>
            <p>Once your group agrees on what will or will not happen, place a combined wager based on everyone input.</p>

            <h4>Step 3. <strong>Watch and Review</strong></h4>
            <p>Monitor the outcome of your bet and see how your predictions turn out.</p>
            <hr>
